'''libs/__init__.py

Defines the package 'libs' under comprehensive examples folder. This folder
is intended for storing local libraries: libraries that are local to this module
and cannot be shared/used by other modules

The use of local libraries should be limited to as infrequently as possible: 
good testscript and library design should always be re-useable somewhere else.

Note:
    the usage of local library files is entirely optional. 

    It is not an AEtest script infrastructure requirement, but rather, a 
    recommended standard to follow in order to produce clearly defined, 
    re-useable & maintainable testscripts.
